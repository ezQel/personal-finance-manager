# Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the following:

- Using tailwind in an angular application
- Developing components using angular CDK
- Saving data locally with pouchdb
- Unit testing in angular

# Getting Started

1. Install `nvm` then `node` & `npm`: `brew install nvm && nvm install`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Recommended `node` setup

In order to have more consistent builds, use a strict `node` and `npm` version as defined in the `package.json` `engines` field and `.nvmrc` file. It is recommended to install `node` via `nvm` for easy node version management. Automatic `node` version switching can be installed for [`zsh`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#zsh) or [`bash`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#bash) using `nvm`.

## Running the web app ðŸ•¸

- To run the **development web app**: `npm start` or `ng serve`

# Testing
